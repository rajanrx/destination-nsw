# Developer Test for Destinations NSW

## Purpose
The purpose of this test is to determine your proficiency with Web Services, PHP skills as well as jQuery and CSS.

## Task
Build a single page application that uses data provided from the [ATDW Atlas API](http://govhack.atdw.com.au/API/atlas.html) to list all accommodation in the Blue Mountains. When an product is clicked the user should get a popup showing details of the listing.

The visual result we want is to have a page that uses AJAX to call the web service to display content. Ideally in a Bootstrap layout.

### Data source
Data can be called using the methods defined at [ATDW Atlas API](http://govhack.atdw.com.au/API/atlas.html). All documentation can be found via this link.
For development the API key is: `2015201520159`

### What we are looking for
* Documentation
* Code style
* Commit history
* Ideally responses will be handled in JSON

For applicants applying for Senior Developer positions this task should be completed in an Object Oriented approach. 
For these applicants the use of Composer and [Packagist](https://packagist.org/) dependencies is strongly encouraged.

### Bonus
Additional consideration will be given for:

* Implementation of pagination (or infinite scroll)
* Reporting on total products found

### Hint
The ATDW uses UTF-16LE encoding.
